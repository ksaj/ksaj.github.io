# My Pet Peeves

These are in no particular order. But these things tick me off one way or other.

## Content Not Available In Your Area/Country/Etc

In general, I don't care if you want your content to only be served to a specific geographical area. I'm even a-okay with that. But if you do provide content to only a restricted geographical area, do *not* host it on a site with 'www' in the URL. If your site specifies it is for the WORLD-WIDE web, then bloody make it accessible WORLD-WIDE! Otherwise, choose a different host name.
