# Baby its cold outside
#### (c) Oct 2018 Karsten Johansson

It's Canada. And, as the popular meme keeps reminding us, Winter is coming.

Ever wonder why the weather reporter assures everyone that it is 10 degrees outside, yet you are already freezing your butt off? In the Spring, 10 degrees gets the birds singing, plants growing green, and everyone in the neighbourhood finding the next best excuse to be outside. Why is that 10 degrees so very different than this one?

Let's look at this through my own personal anecdata.

Remember when you were a kid and you could spend hours playing in the snow, and *still* enjoy the walk home? Remember walking across a sunny beach, enduring the scorch from the ridiculously hot sand? Our bodies adjust to a range of temperatures that, out of context, would be insufferable. And that's essentially it: Your body acclimatizes to the current temperature *range*.

A decade ago I landed a gig that, for better or for worse, landed me in Riyadh for 8 months. In that time, temperatures spiked to more than 50 degrees. Toronto summers are typically around 31 on the non-heatwave days, so it was pretty harsh at first. But I got used to it over time.

When I left Riyadh in February, I very suddenly experienced Toronto at below degrees. I hadn't felt outdoor temperatures lower than 24 degrees in months, so this felt pretty extreme. I was completely layered in warm clothing, and STILL complaining about how cold it was *indoors*. People were even joking about it, but is really did take a month or so for my body to get used to the lack of what would otherwise be summer heat.

By summer, though, we got temperatures up to 32 (plus humidity) and for me, it was really tame. It reminded me about something I only ever experienced in Riyadh - the air being so very hot that the inside back of each finger would feel oddly cold from the wind turbulence between them while walking. Usually you don't really notice how much air movement results from swinging your arms at normal walking speed. But at 50 degrees, you can't not notice it. I've never felt that in Toronto, even during our recent out-of-character 40 degree heat waves.

So clearly my body was still adapted to the desert heat.

But by July or August, I was sweating it out with everyone else.

Then that reminded me of another temperature related Riyadh experience. During the winter Eid, I went to the corner store to pick up some milk. To me, the temperature was cool, but really a-okay. On the was, I became aware of a group of Pinoy workers waiting for the bus, all wrapped in blankets and looking miserable about the "coldness." As it was a short walk, I was in regular pants and long-sleeve shirt. They looked at me as if I was mad.

I came to realize that the perception of temperature is a lot like time. Its extremes are almost entirely in your head.

Your perception of temperature is based on what your body expects to feel. Sometimes you can even be distracted enough you don't really notice time fly by, or the heat blazing away.

So after a cold winter, when your body expects to shiver but is is 10 degrees out, it feels positively heavenly. But after this year of Toronto's 40 degree heat waves, that same 10 degrees is literally 30 degrees colder than what your body has acclimatized to. That 30 degrees is the difference between icy roads and a blessed sun tan. 

And that, at least anecdotally, is why 10 degrees feels so warm in spring, yet so cold in Autumn.
