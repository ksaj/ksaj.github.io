# The Apparent Display of Specific Cognition and Recognition in Non-Human Life Forms



(Concept)

What is the significance of recognizing the self in the mirror? Does it make the animal self aware if they behave in a particularly uncanny manner?

The question I ask: Does the animal simply recognize another from the same species, and *that* one has a red dot on its tummy (when none of the others ever did) and want to ask that fish to display its red dot better by mimicking *this* movement.

I don't believe the fish in this recent article recognize themselves. I don't believe the elepants do, either. I do believe they recognize something of their "tribe" that they don't recognize, and are simply asking for a better look at it.

(Proposal)

Instead of a mirror, let them watch videos displaying these differences. Different monkey, elephant, or fish, but the same red dot.

They probably will find it harder to convince the other to show off their dots (the mirror always obeys... fancy that). But I question whether the animals will still try to convince the other to fully display their unusual mark by mimicking that behaviour. I suspect they will.

This would provide a better understanding into what they're actually responding to.
