# The Apparent Display of Specific Cognition and Recognition in Non-Human Higher Life Forms



(Concept)

What is the significance of recognizing the self in the mirror? Does it make the animal self aware if they behave in a particularly uncanny manner?

The question I ask: Does the animal simply recognize another from the same species, and *that* one has a red dot on its tummy (when none of the others ever did) and want to ask that fish to display its red dot better by mimicking *this* movement.

I don't believe the fish in this recent article recognize themselves. I don't believe the elepants do, either. I do believe they recognize something of their "tribe" that they don't recognize, and are simply asking for a better look at it.

(Proposal)

Instead of a mirror, let them watch videos displaying these differences. Different monkey, elephant, or fish, but the same red dot.

They probably will find it harder to convince the other to show off their dots (the mirror always obeys... fancy that). But I question whether the animals will still try to convince the other to fully display their unusual mark by mimicking that behaviour. I suspect they will.

This would provide a better understanding into what they're actually responding to.

(Likely Conclusion)

Non-human animals do not recognize themselves in mirrors. They recognize species similarity, and request mimickry to the reflected non-human animal to display the notable difference so that it can be inspected. Other elephants, for example, would do a similar "Do This!" action to others in the hopes of finding out if they also have that same red dot.

It isn't self-aware. It is difference-aware, which is already a given in how species recognize members of the same species.

Compare to CV. The classification is there, but the self-aware is only at its weakest point of evolutionary progression that relates to our current human level of magnetude.

They've proven some speciese can recognize surprise differences, and attempt to communicate their desire to inspect that surprising difference.

That is to say, if the change was not a red dot, but something substantial that still remains true to the expected form of the species, I expect this symptom of "self awareness" would disappear. The animal isn't self-aware at any level different than other animals as Humans are. It can and will happen (given the chance) but scientists who have proclaimed othersise are victims of the Uncanny Valley.

(Prove me wrong)
