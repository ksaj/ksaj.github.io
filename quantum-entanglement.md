# Quantum Entanglement for Less Magical Thinking Folk

You've heard a lot about quantum this and quantum that, and it sounds like a whole lot of woo. Here I'm going to give my *spin* on explaining it. But to do that, I'm going to use as little of the industry jargon and none of the media hype as possible.

Let's start with a photon and a prism.

Whe a photon enters one side of the prism, two photons are reflected and sent in opposing directions from the other two sides. Because it is a reflection of the same photon, the two resulting photons are mirrored exactly. In fact, if you bounced the photon off a mirror, its actual reflection (that say, hits the wall beside you) and the reflected (that hits the wall you only see in the mirror) share the exact spin, but mirrored.  If you were able to spot both of them at the exact same moment in time, their phases will be aligned in the opposing directions. Keep that in mind.

Now, if we instead send the two mirrored (entangled) photons down a longer or shorter path to their destinations, it means they will not arrive at the same time. So the sensors are calibrated so the time difference between each recipient of the photon particles - one is just subtracted from the other, which takes care of difference in distance each photon travels.

So in a way, we've just basically said that as long as we know the exact difference in time the photons arrive for both recipients, the closer recipient introduces a delay so that when both parties view the particle, they are in the same phase -- spinning the same-but-opposite way.

How is that any different? The sensor callibration also has to take into account the different in time the sensors create by slowing down the photon travel. So if another prism appears between the sender and one of the recipients, they have both received their stolen photon too early compared to the first recipient, and too late for the second recipient. That means the particular photon they have does not match the spin of recipient A. Since it took another splitter (prism) for the interloper to obtain one of the reflections of that photon, which is now on a different trajectory and spinning the wrong way, there is also some delay added.  Now recipient B not only recieves the photon later than they should, it is also spinning the wrong way and useless. 

None of the photons are valid.

This is why it *feels like* the information is transferred at faster than light speed. It isn't. It is SENSED at the same moment, give or take a tiny amount of time to account for distance and hardware. The simple reason observation kills the information is because you have to entangle new photons in order to read one and pass it on. But both of them are now wrong because an interloper slowed it down and changed its spin.

Think about how networking works. If your stream of photons is treated essentially like binary (but better), then your packets will all end with a checksum of sorts. If the packet contained an error, the checksum won't match, and you resend the packet so eventually the message gets there.

The randomness you can envision with all this photonic travel time, and bouncing through different transmitters and sensors adds quite a lot of noise, making it an expensive problem to solve before things get practical. Early IP networks were pretty noisy and crappy. Look at how they go now! The information on the Internet travels at a very bumpy version of that light speed (ie: not through a vacuum), so it isn't all that unreasonable to expect we'll very soon be sending quantum information using pretty much this exact method.

So the information doesn't get their faster. But it does get there without anyone else seeing it. The message packets just keep getting resent until the recipient obtains a packet with a matching checksum value.

It's not a very "spooky" factoid when you look at it purely mechanically. This is also why we can coax out quantum behavior from water, electricity, and other things that move around easily. We can even demonstrate quantum weirdness using 3 polarized lenses like you get from the cinema. We'll get there faster than the speed of light
