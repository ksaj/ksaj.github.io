# Under Construction

Stuff is being uploaded slowly but surely, and the page should be live soon. So I've left a couple itty bits for those who venture by.

## Learning LISP

[Here's a joke](https://byrslf.co/lisp-f1258a476fc6) I like about LISP to tie you over:

> A student is about to graduate with a degree in Computer Science, when her faculty advisor notices a hole in her academic profile.
> 
> “You haven’t studied LISP,” the professor says. “This is bad. You can’t graduate if you don’t know LISP.”
> 
> So the student spends the final weeks of senior year teaching herself LISP. She avoids all her friends, skips all the senior year parties, and spends eighteen hours a day in the computer lab, studying the history of LISP, reading LISP programming books, and writing LISP compilers.
> 
> The day before graduation, she presents her work to the professor.
> 
> “I’ve got to hand it to you,” the professor says. “I’m very impressed. You’ve buckled down, worked hard, and totally pulled it off. You really know your LISP.”
> 
> “Thank you,” the student says. “So how will I use it in my work?”
> 
> “Oh, nobody <u>*uses*</u> it.”

## A rant about tired old lie everyone likes to keep on spouting

The wannabe debunker's claim is that we are brought to believe we only use 10% of our brains. Wikipedia spells out a [number of studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth) that prove that we use our entire brains, and that every part of the brain has its function.

Case closed? Absolutely not. 

*The so-called scientists quoted aren't arguing the same thing!*

Here's what they are really arguing, as quoted from the Wikipedia article:

> the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability.

and

> Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power.

and

> we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity

Somehow these supposedly skeptical experts can't parse the words 'ability', 'power' and 'capacity'.

Let me reword this in a way that even these morons can understand.

> The average driver only uses ten percent of their car's latent power, ability and capacity

Nowhere does that suggest all drivers *omit* the use of their cars' engines. They just don't use <u>all</u> of its power, ability and capacity. They're not trying to go from 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds, or cruising at 380 km/h, or turning 180 degrees on a dime without skidding or flipping. 

They are using 100% of the engine (among other features) that slower drivers are using. The brain claim is about power, ability and capacity. ONLY.

The people arguing this are supposedly scientists. But in perpetuating this inane stupidity, they're probably *actually* only using 10% of their brains.

# TODO

Each section in this TODO will become proper links as I start to populate them. Until they get [x], consider them raw and incomplete. Then this index will be updated to ct like a proper content repository.

- [ ] Upload www.PENETRATIONTEST.com site to github
- [ ] Create content repo to share between PT and the Security section here, and link them
- [ ] Historical Infosec and hacking content
- [ ] Lisp language stuff
- [ ] Raspberry Pi projects (configs, mpich, electronics, NiTi muscle wire etc.)
- [ ] Merlin's Whim (Magic and Mentalism)
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Glögg
- [ ] Misc Thoughts (psychology, weird math, life, word games etc.)
