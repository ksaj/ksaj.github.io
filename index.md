## Meh...

Ignore this for now, unless you are a trooper with an adventurous spirit. It will all come together soon...

For now, the casual reader is better off fleeing in another direction. The insanity will probably only make sense to me, myself and I. Of curse you are welcome to peek and poke, but it won't be pretty for a while... trust me. Once the general outline is completed, this index page will cease to be my TODO list and begin to perform a more public function.

For now, I'm assuming everything (on this cheatsheet)[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet] works here. Anyway, the following pile of noodles is basically a prettier Pastebin until I got the flow down. All of the (currently invisible) content is written in Macdown, so hopefully it is mostly already compatible.

If you've read this far (why??) here's a jike about LISP: https://byrslf.co/lisp-f1258a476fc6

# A rant about tired old lie about the brain everyone seems to keep spouting

The debunker's claim is that we are brought to believe we only use 10% of our brains. Wikipedia spells out a (number of studies)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth] that prove that we use our entire brains, and that every part of the brain has its function.

Case closed? Absolutely not. 

*The wannabe scientists quoted aren't arguing the same thing!*

Here's what they are really arguing, as quoted from the Wikipedia article:

> the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability.

and

> Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power.

and

> we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity

Somehow these supposedly skeptical experts can't parse the words 'ability', 'power' and 'capacity'.

Let me reword this in a way that even these morons can understand.

> The average car driver only uses ten percent of their car's latent power, ability and capacity

Nowhere does that suggest all drivers *omit* the use of their cars' engines. They just don't use all of its power, ability and capacity. THEY ARE STILL USING THE ENTIRE ENGINE.

The people arguing this are supposedly scientists. Susrely they could grasp such a simple concept?
