# Learning LISP

[Here's a joke](https://byrslf.co/lisp-f1258a476fc6) I like about LISP to tie you over.

## A rant about tired old lie everyone likes to keep on spouting

The wannabe debunker's claim is that we are brought to believe we only use 10% of our brains. Wikipedia spells out a [number of studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth) that prove that we use our entire brains, and that every part of the brain has its function.

Case closed? Absolutely not. 

*The so-called scientists quoted aren't arguing the same thing!*

Here's what they are really arguing, as quoted from the Wikipedia article:

> the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability.

and

> Scientists and psychologists tell us we use only about TEN PERCENT of our brain power.

and

> we might be using only five to ten percent of our mental capacity

Somehow these supposedly skeptical experts can't parse the words 'ability', 'power' and 'capacity'.

Let me reword this in a way that even these morons can understand.

> The average driver only uses ten percent of their car's latent power, ability and capacity

Nowhere does that suggest all drivers *omit* the use of their cars' engines. They just don't use <u>all</u> of its power, ability and capacity. They're not trying to go from 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds, or cruising at 380 km/h, or turning 180 degrees on a dime without skidding or flipping. THEY ARE STILL USING THE ENTIRE ENGINE.

```
They are using 100% of the engine and other features that slower cars are using. The brain claim is about power, ability and capacity. ONLY.
```

The people arguing this are supposedly scientists. But they've (probably intentionally) glossed over the obvious reality. Next time you feel the urge to perpetuate this nonsense, seriously consider using more of your brain's power, ability and capacity.

# TODO

Each section in this TODO will become proper links as I start to populate them. Until they get [x], consider them raw and incomplete. Then this index will be updated to ct like a proper content repository.

- [ ] Upload www.PENETRATIONTEST.com site to github
- [ ] Create content repo to share between PT and the Security section here, and link them
- [ ] Historical Infosec and hacking content
- [ ] Lisp language stuff
- [ ] Raspberry Pi projects (configs, mpich, electronics, NiTi muscle wire etc.)
- [ ] Merlin's Whim (Magic and Mentalism)
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Glögg
- [ ] Misc Thoughts (psychology, weird math, life, word games etc.)
