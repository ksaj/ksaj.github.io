# Under Construction

Stuff is being uploaded slowly but surely, and the page should be live soon. So I've left a couple itty bits for those who venture by.

## Learning LISP

[Here's a joke](https://byrslf.co/lisp-f1258a476fc6) I like about LISP to tie you over:

> A student is about to graduate with a degree in Computer Science, when her faculty advisor notices a hole in her academic profile.
> 
> “You haven’t studied LISP,” the professor says. “This is bad. You can’t graduate if you don’t know LISP.”
> 
> So the student spends the final weeks of senior year teaching herself LISP. She avoids all her friends, skips all the senior year parties, and spends eighteen hours a day in the computer lab, studying the history of LISP, reading LISP programming books, and writing LISP compilers.
> 
> The day before graduation, she presents her work to the professor.
> 
> “I’ve got to hand it to you,” the professor says. “I’m very impressed. You’ve buckled down, worked hard, and totally pulled it off. You really know your LISP.”
> 
> “Thank you,” the student says. “So how will I use it in my work?”
> 
> “Oh, nobody *<u>uses</u>* it.”

# TODO

Each section in this TODO will become proper links as I start to populate them. Until they get [x], consider them raw and incomplete. Then this index will be updated to ct like a proper content repository.

- [ ] Upload www.PENETRATIONTEST.com site to github
- [ ] Create content repo to share between PT and the Security section here, and link them
- [ ] Historical Infosec and hacking content
- [ ] Lisp language stuff
- [ ] Raspberry Pi projects (configs, mpich, electronics, NiTi muscle wire etc.)
- [ ] Merlin's Whim (Magic and Mentalism)
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Glögg
- [ ] Misc Thoughts (psychology, weird math, life, word games etc.)
